  <h1>Oh, hello. I’m Kelly Tomlinson.</h1>
  <br/><br/>
  <h2>Leader. Designer. Thinker.</h2>
  <br/><br/><br/>
  <h3>I believe in the power of design to solve real problems in ways that meet customer's needs and business goals. I love to think strategically and back it up with the details of how we can achieve it, and I know how to balance design integrity with delivery. I love building teams to value cross-collaboration with shared understanding, knowledge, goals, and accountability.</h3>
  <p>I’m currently Head of Design at <a href="https://hireup.com.au/">Hireup</a>, leading + growing a team designing internal and customer-facing digital products to disrupt property management in Australia. I love <a href="https://instagram.com/tastebudsovereverything">great food</a>, sometimes <a href="https://instagram.com/kellycreatesagain">I draw</a>, and I have a pretty handsome <a href="https://instagram.com/oscardelashiba">furbaby<a/>.</p>
